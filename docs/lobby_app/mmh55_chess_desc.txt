     This mode is meant for all games played in H55 'Chess mode', duel mode with predefined armies and skills.

<Span Foreground="Red">What is Chess mode?</Span>

Replaces vanilla duel mode feature, it grants combat matches as if the combat map is truly a Chess game and victory is 100% decided only by player skill. <Bold>It will completely ignore the rules of the H55 class system and be more like 'another game in a game'.</Bold>.
