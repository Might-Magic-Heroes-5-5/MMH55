mov eax, [ebp+heap_array]  -- eax = address_of (ebp + heap_array)
dword ptr [eax], 10 -- PUT value (doubleword) 10 at address space EAX

array allocation:
- Global 
- Stack - array elements are defined in beggining of function with minus
- Heap - array index points to a place in the heap

structure allocation:
- Global
- Stack - stack elements are defined in beggining of function with minus
- Heap - When a structure has been allocated in the heap, the only reference to the
structure available to the compiler is the pointer to the structureâ€™s starting address


fld xxxxx -> push float value to top of stack
fstp [ebp + var] - pushes top of the stack to the address


this - parameter in function means the function is executed from an object and that object is parsed as the first parameter in the function.

object1->func() is equal to func(this) in IDA


Code cross refferences:
- ordinary  -> sequential flow from one instruction to another
- jump (xref j)
-- short
-- long
- call (xref p)
-- short 
-- long

Data Cross-References:
- r - read location;  called from instruction(.text) location only
- w - write location; called from instruction(.text) location only
- o - offset from location; called from both - instruction(.text) and data locations(.rdata)
