ADVENTURE MAP VIEW:
New:
- ARMG places 28 new artifacts + 6 new ultimate items obtainable by quests.
- ARMG places ~30 more adventure map objects and an additional 480 (for a total of 720) random mixed neutral templates. The object and army variation will be much greater than H5 maps currently in existance
- ARMG can balance player starting areas much better (only differences in adventure objects that have minor impact on the game such as morale boosters remain)
- In addition to towns, dwellings and mines, Witch huts can now be placed exactly symmetrical, Shrine and primary skill boosters are precisely valued
- ARMG can distinguish between early, mid and late game areas and properly adjust challenges and rewards to the player
- ARMG can generate maps with size up to XXXL 320x320 with underground
- ARMG places all the objects missing in the original RMG except the swan pond. The Dwarven Warren functions as a windmill and the windmill as a waterwheel (this only applies to RMG maps, not human made maps)
- ARMG does not randomly swap between valuable adv objects like artifact merchant and weak adv objects like war machine factory
- All new objects are placed with respect to blocked and active tiles and many more objects are guarded
- Objects are not placed completely random, but only in areas where they are useful and don't ruin the balance
- ARMG places seer huts with random generated quests. The seer huts know which artifacts the RMG has a tendency to duplicate and therefore collecting more then one is rewarded. This will turn duplicate artifact placements in a fun feature
- 2 new battlemaps for the Dwarven scenery and 3 battle maps will have random obstacles
- new landscape themes for almost all factions and all tiles use better quality DXT3 textures and/or new HD textures
- new manual found heroes V game folder for the Advanced RMG will provide visualizations of the zoning schemes for all new templates
